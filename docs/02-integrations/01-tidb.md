## Create an API Key

Only the **owner** of an organization can create an API key.

To create an API key in an organization, perform the following steps:

1. Click **Organization** in the lower-left corner of the TiDB Cloud console.
2. Click **Organization Settings**. The organization settings page is displayed.
3. Click the **API Keys** tab and then click **Create API Key**.
4. Enter a description for your API key. The role of the API key is always Owner currently.
5. Click **Next**. Copy and save the public key and the private key.
6. Make sure that you have copied and saved the private key in a secure location. The private key only displays upon the creation. After leaving this page, you will not be able to get the full private key again.
7. Click **Done**.
