If you want to know why not use AWS, please read the [Why should you not use AWS Lambda as the Function for Serverless WordPress?](https://www.serverless-wordpress.cloud/2024/01/08/why-not-aws-lambda/) blog.

In this guide, we will show you below questions:

1. How to create a RAM Role to allow Lougao to access your Alibaba Cloud resources?
2. How to obtain the **ARN** for that role?
3. How to obtain the Alibaba Cloud **Main Account ID**?

After you have the above information, you can use it to integrate Lougao with your Alibaba Cloud account.

:::tip Before you start

Before you start, you need to have an Alibaba Cloud account. If you don't have an Alibaba Cloud account, you can create one [here](https://account.alibabacloud.com/register/intl_register.htm).

Congratulations! You have created a RAM Role to allow Lougao to access your Alibaba Cloud resources, after you have the **ARN** for that role and the Alibaba Cloud **Main Account ID**, you can use it to integrate Lougao with your Alibaba Cloud account.

## Obtain the ARN for the Role

You can obtain the **ARN** for the role you created at the **Basic Information** page of the role.

Next, you can use [Lougao console](https://console.serverless-wordpress.cloud) to start creating your full-stack Serverless WordPress website.

## Activate required Alibaba Cloud services (You can do this later)

Additionally, Lougao requires Alibaba Cloud's **FC**, **NAS**, and **SLS** services. Therefore, if you havenâ€™t activated these services yet, please activate them first, or you can do so later.
